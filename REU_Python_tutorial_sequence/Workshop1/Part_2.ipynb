The dark interior is where the shock has already passed by and the bright red/pink ring around it is where the shock is currently impacting the gas cloud. Most of the circular features (bubbles) in these images are produced by hot young stars, as winds and radiation from these young stars sweep up the surrounding gas and dust from which they formed (like a snowplow that compresses the snow in its path.) Sometimes, the swept-up material becomes dense enough for gravity to pull it together to form new stars.” -- Zooniverse Milky Way\n",
